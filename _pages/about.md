I am a student researcher and pre-medical neuroscience student at the University of California, Los Angeles.

I am an undergraduate neuroscience student and researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am interested in neurology and translational neuroscience, with a focus on the determination of biomarkers and the discovery of novel treatment and diagnostic targets. My research leverages imaging and systems neuroscience to explore cognitive and functional connectivity changes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rodent models. Currently, I work in the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center, where I integrate imaging techniques with behavioral analysis to deepen our understanding of TBI's impact on the brain.

In addition to my work at UCLA, I am involved in clinical research in the neurosurgery department at Cedars-Sinai, where I study surgical outcomes for pituitary adenomas and contribute to clinical trials focused on pituitary adenoma and glioblastoma. I hope to extend my research into neurodegenerative diseases during my future MD/PhD training, with an emphasis on applying advanced imaging and experimental techniques to develop innovative treatments.


Selected recent and current research projects:
- Dynamic functional connectivity and network structure after TBI
- Utility of fluorescent imaging in glioblastoma removal
- Impact of dopamine agonist treatment in pituitary adenoma surgical outcomes
- Impact of multi-site data harmonization on structural imaging data
- Cognitive flexibility and functional imaging after rodent TBI
- Analysis of functional connectivity after rodent brain injury using EEG and graph theory analysis
