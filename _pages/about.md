About me

I am a student researcher and pre-medical neuroscience student at the University of California, Los Angeles.

I am an undergraduate neuroscience student and researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am interested in neurology and translational neuroscience, with a focus on the determination of biomarkers and the discovery of novel treatment and diagnostic targets. My research leverages imaging and systems neuroscience to explore cognitive and functional connectivity changes following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rodent models. Currently, I work in the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center, where I integrate imaging techniques with behavioral analysis to deepen our understanding of TBI's impact on the brain.

In addition to my work at UCLA, I am involved in clinical research in the neurosurgery department at Cedars-Sinai, where I study surgical outcomes for pituitary adenomas and contribute to clinical trials focused on pituitary adenoma and glioblastoma. I hope to extend my research into neurodegenerative diseases during my future MD/PhD training, with an emphasis on applying advanced imaging and experimental techniques to develop innovative treatments.

Selected recent and current research projects:
- Dynamic functional connectivity and network structure after TBI
- Utility of fluorescent imaging in glioblastoma removal
- Impact of dopamine agonist treatment in pituitary adenoma surgical outcomes
- Impact of multi-site data harmonization on structural imaging data
- Cognitive flexibility and functional imaging after rodent TBI
- Analysis of functional connectivity after rodent brain injury using EEG and graph theory analysis




**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
